# daart_utils: utilities for training and analyzing daart models

## Installation

First you'll have to install the `daart` package, which contains the base modeling code - follow the 
directions [here](https://github.com/themattinthehatt/daart).
Then, in the command line, navigate to where you'd like to install the `daart_utils` package and move 
into that directory:
```
$: git clone https://github.com/themattinthehatt/daart_utils
$: cd daart_utils
```

Next, active the `daart` conda environment and locally install the `daart_utils` package.

```
$: conda activate daart
(daart) $: pip install -r requirements.txt
(daart) $: pip install -e .
```
